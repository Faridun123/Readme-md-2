Components
Components 
are independent 
and reusable 
bits of code.
01
Creating Component
This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single 
“props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and 
returns a React element. We call such components “function 
components” because they are literally JavaScript functions.
Props
props are the values that you pass down to your React
component

Handling events with React elements is very similar to 
handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax 
differences:
React events are named using camelCase, rather than 
lowercase.
With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, 
rather than a string.

Keys help React identify which
